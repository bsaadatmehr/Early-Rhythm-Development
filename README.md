# Early-Rhythm-Development
Scripts for the manuscript entitled " Hierarchical neural encoding of rhythm develops during the third trimester of human gestation ".
Note that the Matlab analysis script requires a running version of the EEGLAB toolbox (https://github.com/sccn/eeglab.git), Fieldtrip toolbox (https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip.git), and circStat toolbox (https://github.com/circstat/circstat-matlab.git).

There are 4 scripts:

1) StimulusBrainSynchronization.m: To calculate neural synchronization to metrical periodicities.

2) SSEP.m: To conduct the frequency-tagging approach.

3) Stat_Synchronization.m: To perform statistical analysis of Stimulus Brain Synchronization.

4) stat_FrequencyTagging.m: To perform statistical analysis of the SSEP.

The data required to run each script is specified in the corresponding script.
